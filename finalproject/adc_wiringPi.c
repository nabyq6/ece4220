// converted value. You can read about SPI communication for further details.
// The communication can be done "by hand": mapping registers, configuring the appropriate
// GPIO ports, sending and receiving data using functions like ioctl(), etc. However, the
// wiringPi SPI utility does the work for us.
// You can implement the SPI communication "by hand", if you feel adventurous...
